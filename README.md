# Dart: Handling Non-Existent Keys in JSON Response

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with JSON responses: attempting to access a key that does not exist in the JSON data.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that throws an exception due to this issue.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version that safely handles the potential absence of the key.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Dart SDK installed.
3. Run the examples using the Dart command line.

## Usage

Run the `bug.dart` file to see the exception. Then, compare it with the corrected version in `bugSolution.dart` to understand how to properly handle potential missing keys.
